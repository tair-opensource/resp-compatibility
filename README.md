 resp-compatibility is used to test whether your redis-like database is compatible with Redis versions (such as
6.0, 7.0, etc.)  [中文文档](README-CN.md)

# Install

requires `Python 3.7` or later.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Testable Commands

Refer to [this table](cts_refer.md) for the commands that CTS can test and their corresponding version information.

# How to use

```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --host HOST           the redis host
  --port PORT           the redis port
  --password PASSWORD   the redis password
  --testfile TESTFILE   the redis compatibility test cases
  --specific-version {1.0.0,2.8.0,3.2.0,4.0.0,5.0.0,6.0.0,6.2.0,7.0.0,7.2.0}
                        the redis version
  --show-failed         show details of failed tests
  --cluster             server is a node of the Redis cluster
  --ssl                 open ssl connection
  --genhtml             generate test report in html format
```
e.g. Test whether host:port is compatible with redis 6.2.0 and display failure case: 
```
$ python3  resp_compatibility.py -h host -p port --testfile cts.json --specific-version 6.2.0 --show-failed
Connecting to 127.0.0.1:6379 use standalone client
test: del command passed
test: unlink command passed
...
test: xtrim command with MINID/LIMIT passed
-------- The result of tests --------
Summary: version: 6.2.0, total tests: 285, passed: 285, rate: 100.00%
```
More examples are shown `python3  resp_compatibility.py -h`.

## cluster
Redis has two modes from the API level, namely `Standalone` (Sentinel has no API restrictions like Standalone) and `Cluster`, where the command support of Standalone does not require Cross slot, but Cluster restricts multi-key commands to be executed in the same slot (e.g. mset/mget ), therefore, we support `--cluster` to test the compatibility of cluster mode, you can test your Redis Cluster cluster compatibility as follows:
```
$ python3.9  resp_compatibility.py --testfile cts.json --host 127.0.0.1 --port 30001 --cluster --specific-version 6.2.0
connecting to 127.0.0.1:30001 use cluster client
test: del command passed
test: unlink command passed
...
test: xtrim command with MINID/LIMIT passed
-------- The result of tests --------
Summary: version: 6.2.0, total tests: 260, passed: 260, rate: 100.00%
```

## genhtml
You can use `--genhtml` to generate a test report similar to the html of this [website](https://tair-opensource.github.io/resp-compatibility/). It should be noted that this option will read the configuration in [config.yaml](config.yaml) for testing. Special attention needs to be paid, at this time the `specific-version` specified in your command line will be overwritten by the one in the configuration file.
```
$ python3.9  resp_compatibility.py --testfile cts.json --genhtml --show-failed
directory html already exists, will be deleted and renewed.
start test Redis for version 4.0.0
connecting to 127.0.0.1:6379 using standalone client
start test Redis for version 5.0.0
connecting to 127.0.0.1:6379 using standalone client
start test Redis for version 6.0.0
connecting to 127.0.0.1:6379 using standalone client
start test Redis for version 7.0.0
connecting to 127.0.0.1:6379 using standalone client
...
Visit http://localhost:8000 for the report.
```
Then, a Http Server will be started on http://localhost:8000 by default, and you can access it to get reports.

## More uses

### Verify before migrating your database
When you need to migrate the business system from A database to B, in order to prevent the incompatibility of B, you can write your own `cts.json` (compatibility-test-suite) to verify the compatibility of B database system, the format example is as follows :
```
[
   {
     "name": "del command",
     "command": [
       "set k v",
       "del k"
     ],
     "result": [
       "OK",
       1
     ],
     "since": "1.0.0"
   }
]
```
Overall, it is a JSON array, containing multiple test cases, each of which is a JSON Object, and `command` and `result` are in one-to-one correspondence. In addition to the fields in the example, there are some as follows:

| name           | value                 | meaning                                                                                  |
|----------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| tags           | standalone or cluster | This case is only allowed in the mode specified by tags                                  |
| skipped        | true                  | skip this case                                                                           |
| command_binary | true                  | Convert the command to binary, such as the command contains non-visible ascii characters |
| sort_result    | true                  | Sort the returned results                                                                |

### Test with another programming language
The main work of this project is that we have added more than 7000 lines of tests in `cts.json`, if you want to implement tests in other programming languages (such as Java, Go, Rust, etc.), then you only need to parse `cts.json ` format, and execute the tests sequentially, have fun.
